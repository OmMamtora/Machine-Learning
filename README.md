# Machine Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my step-by-step journey of learning **Machine Learning from scratch**.

I started with very little knowledge and began following a **100 Days of Machine Learning** course.  
During the early days (around Day 13), I built my first **Placement Prediction project** mainly for learning and understanding purposes.

Now, I am continuously improving my concepts, uploading notes, datasets, and projects **one by one** as I learn.
